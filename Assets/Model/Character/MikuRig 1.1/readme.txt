Thanks for downloading Miku V 1.1

I am a 2d/3d animator who has in the process of prepping models for animation gotten much better at rigging and Model setup.

It is my hope that by releasing this rig It will help me become more well known in the animation community as well as further

my own education. 

In response to a  request For 1.1 

there has been a smooth modifier option built into the master control. The legs and arm sleeves do not show the  smooth node but everything else
smoothes out correctly. I am currently working on the arm and leg bug. 


Character disclaimer: Hatsune Miku is a singing synthesizer application with a female persona, developed by Crypton Future Media.

 It uses Yamaha Corporation's Vocaloid 2 synthesizing technology. 


I claim no hold or rights to the image or design of this character.
